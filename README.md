# stacksats

A simple little program that creates a window with a progress bar and button. Click the button to advance the progress bar and impatiently wait for the fiat currency upgrade to be over.

I used LinqPad [https://www.linqpad.net/lprun.aspx] to create this, a free and super useful C# script runner, so you'll have to install that to run it. Or you can probably just compile it with csc.exe but I haven't tried that.
